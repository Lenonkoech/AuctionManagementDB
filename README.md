    ```

#### Linux
1. Update your package repository.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update 
    ```
2. Install the MySQL server.
    ```bash 
    sudo apt install mysql-server
    ```
3. Secure your MySQL installation:
    ```bash
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    ```
4. Follow the prompts:
    - Set a root password (if prompted).
    - Remove anonymous users.
    - Disallow root login remotely.
    - Remove the test database.
    - Reload privilege tables.
5. Enable the MySQL service to start automatically at boot:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable mysql
    ```
6. Start the MySQL service immediately:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start mysql
    ```
7. Access MySQL:

## Setup

1. Clone the repository in your project directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lenonkoech/AuctionManagementDB.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd ../../AuctionManagementDB

3. Execute the create the createdb.sql query
   ```bash
   create database if not exists auctionManagement;

4. Execute the create tables queries and be free to manipulate any other data in the project.
